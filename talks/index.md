## Wildlife & forest garden talks

I give talks on all aspects of wildlife, forest gardening and garden design. 

My focus is on using native plants and wild flowers with edibles in an ornamental setting. 

### Costs

* Talks can range from 30-45 minutes
* Existing talk, virtual or in-person `£100`
* In-person `+45p per mile`
* New, bespoke talk `+£150`
* Please note, I live in [West Wales](https://g.page/natureworksgarden?share), will travel for about an hour
* I require a projector with HDMI input and screen. And dark chocolate digestives. Tea, soya milk, no sugar.

Slides for every talk are kept permanently online for future reference. Here is my [free Forest Garden Primer class](https://store.natureworks.org.uk/l/primer), and the [accompanying slides](/slides/primer/) to give you an idea of the format.
