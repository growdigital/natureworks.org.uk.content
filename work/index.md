### Design & education

* **Wildlife & food forest garden designer** — the overarching description of what I do, a combination of wildlife, ornamental and edible garden design.
* **Site surveys** — observing & gathering data to inform the design. Critical.
* **CAD design** — fluent in [QCAD](https://qcad.org/) software.
* **Landscaping** — Working closely with trusted partners, I can organise all aspects of hard landscaping, through to plant costings, purchase and planting.
* **Design sketches** — Incredibly useful for conveying spatial sense of a design.

* **Workshops** — Monthly [YouTube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/natureworksgarden),  numerous [online courses](/courses/), & both online & in-person workshops. Apparently I am enthusiastic and engaging!
* **Schools** — I really enjoy engaging with students of all ages, to explain the philosophy, principles and practise of forest gardening. I used to teach graphic design at [University West of England](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/).
* **Talks** — Online & in-person talks on a range of gardening subjects to gardening clubs & environmental organisations.
* **Tours** — Pre-Covid, I ran regular tours of our forest garden. Hopefully, we will be opening our doors again in 2022.
