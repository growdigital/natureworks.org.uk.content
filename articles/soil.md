4. **Soil test**<br>Run tests on 3-4 different areas of the garden, take top soil sample from **below** the turf line. Check [soil type](https://www.wynnstay.co.uk/wynnstaystores/wynnstay-tetbury/) (sand/clay/silt/loam), using sausage test (roil damp soil, the more sausage it is, the more clay it has) or [jar test](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/soil-texture-analysis-the-jar-test/). Check acidity (pH) and nutrients ([NPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_of_fertilizer#The_NPK_analysis_label)) with a soil test from [Wynnstay farmers co-op](https://www.wynnstay.co.uk/wynnstaystores/wynnstay-tetbury/) (about Â£15 per test). Check the geology by digging narrow hole about half a metre deep, to see what lies beneath the top soil. Check the hydrology by noting soil moisture at different times of the year.
