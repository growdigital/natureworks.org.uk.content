When designing garden elements, itâ€™s good to **stack the functions**, so you have a feature that is doing more than one thing.

For example, these are [dead hedge](/dead-hedge/) functions:

* Windbreak for young trees (until the live windbreaks grow)
* A site for non-compostable brash, roots & prunings
* Wildlife habitat
* A marker for your trees

The same principle can be used for specific plants. Eg a [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) can be used for:

* Windbreak hedge
* Nitrogen fixer
* Wildlife habitat
* Edible fruit
