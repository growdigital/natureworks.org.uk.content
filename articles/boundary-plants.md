Grass makes a cheap and durable path but _will_ creep into borders if they’re not well established or don’t have dense growth. 

As an extra barrier, I often line grass paths with clumping boundary plants to stop ‘Grass Creep’. 

Here are some suggested plants:

* [Big Root Cranesbill (0.5m)](https://pfaf.org/user//Plant.aspx?LatinName=Geranium%20macrorrhizum)
* [Spotted Cranesbill (0.6m)](https://pfaf.org/user//Plant.aspx?LatinName=Geranium%20maculatum)
* [Lemon Balm (0.7m)](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Melissa+officinalis)

Big Root Cranesbill varities recommended by [Penlan Perennials](https://penlanperennials.co.uk/):

* Geranium macrorrhizum ‘Bevans Variety’,  45cm tall, spread 1m. Evergreen, flowers May-October.
* G. macrorrhizum 'Dreamland', 50cm x 50cm, flowers May-September.
* G. macrorrhizum 'Mavis Simpson' 25cm x 90cm, evergreen.
