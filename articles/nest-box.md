The whole point of a forest garden is that you are **working with nature** to grow edible crops. Birds are a critical part of your ecosystem, eating all sorts of insects (as well as the occasional bit of soft fruit). You can encourage them into your garden by creating nest boxes.

You can **[download this nest box plan as a PDF file](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1553198442/plan-bird-nest-box.pdf)**.

Be sure to site the nest box facing **away** from the prevailing wind, in as secluded and sheltered spot as possible, out of the reach of cats and other predators.

The plan is adapted [from the RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/how-you-can-help-birds/nestboxes/nestboxes-for-small-birds/making-and-placing-a-bird-box), really to help my perforated memory. It’s just a **4½ feet of 6"x1"** plan, or 140cm length of 15cm x 2cm in metric. Use **untreated Larch**, as it’s durable and won’t contain chemicals.

What you do need is a [hole saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_saw) for drilling the hole. Different species like different sized holes:

* 25mm for coal tits, marsh tits and blue tits 
* 28mm for great tits and tree sparrows 
* 32mm for nuthatches and house sparrows

Thank you RSPB for all the information.
