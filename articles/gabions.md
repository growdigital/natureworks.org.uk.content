Gabions are robust wire baskets filled with aggregate or timber. They are relatively easy to install and make fantastic wildlife habitat.

[John Little](https://grassroofcompany.co.uk) calls them a [“unit of structural habitat”](https://twitter.com/grassroofco/status/1568930839307624449). Here are some habitats you can include:

* [Bee hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Etjme2w40) (holes in logs, timber or bamboo)
* [Earwig hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPo4C-8y1AI)
* [Hoverfly lagoons](https://www.thebuzzclub.uk/hoverfly-lagoons)
* Bumblebee boxes
* Small mammal homes

They are also great for filling with recyled “waste” aggregate.

## Construction

I used [wirefence.co.uk](https://www.wirefence.co.uk/gabion/build-your-own-custom-gabion/). Materials for custom building your own gabions:

* [75mm diameter, 4mm gauge welded galvanised steel mesh](https://www.ultimate-one.co.uk/galvanised-weld-mesh-panel-244m-122m-75mm-holes-4mm-wire-p-1123) 
* [Gabion mesh clips](https://www.ultimate-one.co.uk/gabion-mesh-clip-cl35-hr35-weld-mesh-netting-clips-100-pack-p-1229) 
* [Mesh clipping pliers](https://www.ultimate-one.co.uk/gabion-weld-wire-mesh-clipping-pliers-tool-ct35-for-cl35-clips-p-1230) 
* [Cold galvanising paint](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=galvanising+paint&ia=web) (for painting the cuts)

### Tips

1. Use minimum 4mm gauge, 3mm bends too easily.
2. Face aggregate nicely, prevents bending. Infill with smaller aggregate.
3. Put in supporting ties on expansive parts, minimises bowing.
4. Incorporate wildlife features.
5. Use diversity recycled materials artfully.
