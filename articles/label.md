In my search for the everlasting, environmentally friendly label for trees, I’ve found the [Dymo Rhino M1011](https://www.dymo.co.uk/label-makers-printers/embossing-label-makers/dymo-rhino-m1011/SP_1364227.html) which embosses aluminium tape.

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1703798088/dymo-rhino-m1011-factory.jpg" alt="Black plastic box and black hand operated labeller, plus tape" caption="Professional labeller for professional labels, with a professional price tag" >}}

About 15cm of the aluminium tape is curled, so that as the branch expands, the label always fits.

The downside is that, as of December 2023, the labeller [retails new for about £500](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dymo-S0720090-Rhino-M1011-Embossing/dp/B000MN95KQ/), and the [4.8m aluminium tape is about £14](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dymo-Rhino-Embosser-Labels-Non-Adhesive/dp/B001R23RCI/). I bought my labeller secondhand on eBay for £120, and found a supplier on eBay [selling the tape for about £6](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/255682879301).

I have a lot of labels to make, but if you don’t have many, an alternative is to use recycled aluminium cans and a [manual alphabet punch set](https://www.etsy.com/uk/market/alphabet_punch_set).
