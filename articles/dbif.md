The [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx) (DBIF for short) is a fantastic resource for wildlife gardeners.

## [dbif.brc.ac.uk](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx)

It shows the known associations between plants and insects, ie which bugs are eating your plants! Use native plants in your garden where possible, as they provide a food source for insects, which are then eaten by other wildlife.

A prolific example of why you should grow native plants is the English or [Pendulate Oak](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Quercus+robur) ([Quercus robur](https://plantatlas.brc.ac.uk/plant/quercus-robur)), which not only supports a whole range of insects that eat it, but also provides habitat, food and protection for a range of animals (including us!).
