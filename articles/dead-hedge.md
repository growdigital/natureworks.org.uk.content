The [benefits of a dead hedge](https://www.woodlands.co.uk/blog/woodland-activities/dead-hedging-wildlife-friendly-and-people-guiding/), [made from cut branches and foliage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_hedge) are:

1. Windbreak shelter for young plants whilst windbreak hedges establish
2. Habitat and food source for wildlife
3. Uses up surplus cuttings rather than have a bonfire
4. Put [Bindweed](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Convolvulus+arvensis), [Bramble](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus) & [Bitter Dock](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rumex+obtusifolius) roots on top to dry out, no need to throw away

They are simple to make: put posts (preferably Larch or Sweet Chestnut as last longer) in pre-made holes with a [post hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_pounder) and pile up the branches inbetween the posts.

We planted a [Yushania anceps 'Pitt White'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/yushania-anceps-pitt-white/) bamboo in the Ornamental Forest Garden but it’s been battered a bit by winds, as the windbreak hedges have yet to get established, and the [Broom](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cytisus+scoparius) nurse trees aren’t in place yet. So a dead hedge is an ideal solution.

## Top tips

* Build the dead hedge near to where you are cutting the branches.
* Use existing stock fencing as one side of the dead hedge.

The dead hedge will take a while to decompose, as the branches aren’t touching the ground. It provides ideal shelter for insects, small birds and small mammals, plus you can top the hedge with more cuttings when it starts to reduce in bulk.
