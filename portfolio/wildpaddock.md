### Consultation on transforming paddock into low&nbsp;maintenance, wildlife & edible haven

The client wanted a framework for transforming a 1½ acre east-facing paddock into a wildlife haven, with edible crops and also with a more cultivated area including ornamental native wild flowers.

The key requirements were:

1. Support diversity of wildlife
2. Low maintenance & sustainable
3. Optimise aesthetics & screening

Because of the size of the paddock, and the requirement for low maintenance, I suggested that only the more cultivated and ornamental area be planted with ground cover, with the rest of the garden divided into 3 ‘wild areas’ and a wild flower meadow.

The three wild areas would be planted with mulched edible tree and shrub crops but the ground cover would be grass, mown on a three-yearly rotation with a wheeled brush cutter.

The wild flower meadow would be surrounded by a hedge, and then have mobile electric fencing for occasional grazing by sheep, the timing of which dependent on the type of wild flowers required.

## Native plants

With the emphasis on wildlife diversity, my forest garden motto of “native where possible” holds particularly true.

To that end, 6 of the 8 windbreak species [I recommended](https://bit.ly/wildpaddock-plants) are native, including [Alder Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Frangula+alnus), [Wild Privet](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ligustrum+vulgare) and [Bloodtwig Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cornus+sanguinea).

The canopy and shrub layers are more focussed on productive species, although there are still natives in the form of [Crabapple](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Malus+sylvestris), [Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Corylus+avellana), and [Hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna).

## Features

The diversity of plant species as a [foodstuff for native insects](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hosts.aspx) is very important. But of equal importance is a diversity of _habitats_. 

* [Wildlife pond](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/clay-lined-pond/), a wildlife magnet for any garden
* [Dead hedge](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/dead-hedge/), great for clearing brash, habitat & shelter
* [Native wild flowers](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/dead-hedge/)
* Thick native hedging
* Wild flower meadow, grazed by sheep
* Grass mown on 3-yearly rotation, range of grass height & maturity

## Maintenance

And finally, ensure a budget for maintenance, both in terms of time and money! A forest garden is low-maintenance once established, so it’s critical to keep on top of the weeding for the first couple of years.
