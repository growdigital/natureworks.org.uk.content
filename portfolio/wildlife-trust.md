## Forest garden workshops

[Birmingham & Black Country Wildlife Trust](https://www.bbcwildlife.org.uk/) have created [EcoPark](https://www.bbcwildlife.org.uk/EcoPark), a groundbreaking inner-city wildlife oasis. 

What makes it groundbreaking is the integration of wildlife conservation and education with a productive forest garden, bringing people even closer to nature through tending the landscape for crops.

This means that [Wildlife Trusts](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/) have begun to recognise that non-native crop plants _can_ be integrated into native ecosystems. When we’re talking about nature, it’s not just native plants.

I was commissioned by their Senior Conservation Officer [Francesca Jaris-Rouse](https://www.bbcwildlife.org.uk/staff-trustees) to provide two [custom built one day workshops](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/talks/wildlifetrust/). The workshops were delivered by Zoom, for staff and volunteers.

Rediscovering and rebuilding the relationships between humans and the nature of which they’re a part is fundamental, and something wildlife and food forest gardens are ideally placed to facilitate. 

It is so exciting to see this taken forward by a Wildlife Trust, for the benefit of future generations.

[Tending the Wild](https://archive.org/details/tendingwildnativ0000ande) by [Kat Anderson](https://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/people/m-anderson) is a rich and engaging history of how indigenous Americans lived in, survived on and cared for their landscape. I recommended it for the Wildlife Trust workshops as it is so pertinent, and I can recommend it for anyone interested in sustainable living, forest gardens and ecology.
