### Wildlife food forest designed for scent & seclusion
          
The clientâ€™s brief was to create a wildlife haven in a private space, with vibrant colours and a liberal use of scent, combined with edible berries and Mediterrean herbs.

The triangular south-facing site is on a clifftop above the side of the house. The structure is defined by a curving gravel path, shielded by both fruiting and evergreen shrubs and a greenwood fence.

Out of sight of the house is a greenwood pergola and beyond, a small, native plant [Tapestry Lawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry_lawn) for sunbathing. This is a non-grass lawn which is mown less frequently than a traditional lawn, and the [native plants](https://bit.ly/tapestry-lawn-natives) support a wide range of invertebrates.

For privacy, habitat and as a food source, I have used native hedging plants, including [Bowles Willow](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Salix+%27Bowles+hybrid%27) to screen the neighbourâ€™s garage, [Wild Privet](https://pfaf.org/User/plant.aspx?latinname=Ligustrum+vulgare) for the scented flowers, [Red Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cornus+sanguinea) for its stems and [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) for its blossom, berries and autumn colour.

The herbs are also ornamental, including [Oregano](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Origanum+vulgare) 'Compactum', [Creeping Thyme](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Thymus_serpyllum), [Rosemary](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rosmarinus+officinalis) 'Tuscan Blue', [Lavender](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lavandula+angustifolia) 'Munstead', [Moroccan Mint](https://mintopia.org/mentha-spicata-var-crispa-moroccan/), [Japanese Mint](https://mintopia.org/mentha-arvensis-var-piperascens/) and [Chamomile](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Chamaemelum+nobile). 

Likewise, many of the berries are also grown for their flowers and autumn foliage, including [Aronia](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Aronia+prunifolia) 'Brilliant', [Mahonia](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Mahonia+aquifolium) 'Apollo', [Blueberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Vaccinium+corymbosum) 'Blue Suede', [Saskatoon](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Amelanchier+alnifolia) and the magnificent centrepiece, the [Strawberry Tree](https://pfaf.org/User/plant.aspx?latinname=Arbutus+unedo).

Initially, the site was quite exposed, so the fencing, planting and shape of the paths have been essential in creating a more intimate yet expanded space.

This has been a fantastic project to work on, with the most thoughtful and engaging clients. The key to so many gardens is **management**. Using the [online notes](https://notes.grwd.uk/clifftop/), [garden plan](https://github.com/growdigital/clifftop/blob/main/clifftop.pdf) and [plant spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/clifftop-plants), the clients are able to identify species and care for them appropriately ðŸ’š.
