Yesterday I started work as a Biodiversity Assistant for Ceredigion Local Nature Partnership working at Ceredigion County Council. 

There is a **lot** of legislation, people and knowledge to get my head around. Here’s a handy list of legislation, for myself really.

* [Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act, 2015](/future-generations/) - put in place to improve the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales
* [Environment (Wales) Act, 2016](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2016/3/contents/enacted) -  puts in place a duty for public bodies to maintain and enhance biodiversity, promoting the resilience of ecosystems, in the exercise of their functions. Referred to as Sct 6 duty. Sct. 7 sets the framework for the
identification of species and habitats of principal importance in Wales
* [Section 7 - Biodiversity lists and duty to take steps to maintain and enhance biodiversity](https://www.biodiversitywales.org.uk/Section-7)
* [Agriculture (Wales) Act 2023](https://www.gov.wales/agriculture-wales-act-2023) - sets the framework for sustainable land management, setting four sustainable land management objectives, including a requirement to ‘maintain and enhance resilience of ecosystems and the benefits they provide’
* [Sustainable Farming Scheme](https://www.gov.wales/sustainable-farming-scheme) - will replace direct payments and Glastir, provides a new funding mechanism for the delivery of outcomes that support nature recovery, climate action and sustainable food production
* [State of Natural Resources Report (SoNaRR) for Wales 2020](https://naturalresources.wales/evidence-and-data/research-and-reports/state-of-natural-resources-report-sonarr-for-wales-2020/?lang=en) - provides the most up to date account of the status of biodiversity in Wales
* [Natural Resources Policy](https://www.gov.wales/natural-resources-policy) - provides a policy framework by the Welsh Government, priorities from
which are set out locally through Area Statements
* [Area Statement](https://naturalresources.wales/about-us/what-we-do/strategies-and-plans/area-statements/mid-wales-area-statement/?lang=en) - specify local priorities, risks and opportunities to implement the priorities of the Natural Resources Policy. Ceredigion falls within the Mid Wales area statement
* [Natural Recovery Action Plan](https://www.gov.wales/nature-recovery-action-plan) - the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Wales
* [Biodiversity Deep Dive: recommendations](https://www.gov.wales/biodiversity-deep-dive-recommendations-html) -  actions to support delivery of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Framework for Nature, including the ’30 by 30’ goal
