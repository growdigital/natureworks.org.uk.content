I have been trying to write a little something every day, somehow related to forest gardening or the work I do.

It has been quite draining of late, less gardening, more admin. Tomorrow, I will be out in the garden, clearing up the polytunnel for the spring. 

With work related stuff, I‘ve been uploading a lot of client videos on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/natureworksgarden). These really are work notes in video form; I’m doing them anyway and upload them for general interest.

I‘ve also started using [Bulk Buffer](https://www.bulkbuffer.com/app), a service that works with [Buffer](https://www.bulkbuffer.com/app), to mass upload messages to my Facebook and Twitter accounts. I interact almost exclusively on Mastodon now [mas.to/@natureworks](https://mas.to/@natureworks) but still autopost stuff to The Other Places just to keep visibility really.
