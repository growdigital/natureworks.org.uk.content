I went to a [KNOCA](https://knoca.eu/) (Knowledge Network on Climate Assemblies) called [Unheard Voices](https://knoca.eu/event/workshop-on-hearing-unheard-voices/), very interesting. Katie Reid, one of the participants, is working on [Young People’s Assemblies](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/blog/240121-young-peoples-assemblies/). 

I am a participant in the [Ceredigion Local Nature Partnership](https://connectceredigion.org.uk/ceredigion-local-nature-partnership), a Welsh government funded initiative to coordinate biodversity action in the county. And I thought, **why not a Biodiversity Assembly**?

I came across this session from KNOCA’s annual event last June, featuring Gaëtane Ricard-Nihoul, Deputy Head of the Unit of 'Citizen Dialogue' in the European Commission and Franciska Rosenkilde, political leader of Denmark's green party, Alternativet.

The idea of embedding and institutionalising assemblies into political practise is very appealing.
