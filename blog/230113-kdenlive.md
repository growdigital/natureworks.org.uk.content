I’m in the midst of editing my 1 hour-ish long [CAD for Gardeners]() class. I guesstimated it would take about 1 day to edit 1 hour of footage. How very wrong I was. It takes about 3 days, or about 1 hour per 5-10 minutes of video (depending on complexity, graphics, titles etc).

Plus, I have never really used [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) either, so there’s a big learning curve there too. The [documentation](https://docs.kdenlive.org/en/) is pretty good though, and the project itself is quite amazing, in the extent of its capabilities. 

A couple of years ago, mid-lockdown, I spent a lot of time editing my [Backyard Forest](/classes/backyard/) course, using [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) on my ancient Mac. It was simpler, and the biggest advantage is that you could adjust the clips graphically on the screen, rather than using a dialog box.

What this does all mean is that I’ll have a nice workflow set up for the remainder of the Wild Edible Classes, which will have more **plants**. Hurrah!
