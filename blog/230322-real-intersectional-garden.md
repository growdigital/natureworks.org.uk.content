I was listening to the [latest episode](https://rootsandall.co.uk/podcast/can-women-save-the-planet/) of my favourite gardening podcast [Roots and All](https://rootsandall.co.uk/), and it was an interview with [Dr Anne Karpf](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/profiles/staff/anne-karpf/) about her book [How Women Can Save The Planet](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/how-women-can-save-the-planet-anne-karpf/4844892?ean=9781787384613). She discussed gender inequality and why the Nature and Climate Emergency is also a gender issue. Absolutely fascinating, and brought together so many ideas.

I wrote a talk called [The Intersectional Garden](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/talks/intersectional/), because in my mind a forest garden is at the intersection. 

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1668523046/venn-intersectional.png" alt="Venn diagram" caption="The forest garden is at the intersection of wildlife, edible and ornamental gardening. But it isn’t really intersectional in the way I thought it was!" >}}

I had borrowed the phrase from [Deepti Gurdusani](https://twitter.com/dgurdasani1), who describes herself as an intersectional feminist. But then I actually looked up what intersectionality actually means, and I wish I’d used a different term, it was proper misappropriation on my part!

There’s [a massive history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), with pioneering work by the leading scholar of [Critical Race Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory), [Kimberlé Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Crenshaw). 

And I heard the podcast on the same day that the [Baroness Casey Review](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/baroness-casey-review-police-racism-homophobia-misogyny/155301/) about misogyny, racism and homophobia in the Met Police was released. And apparently she widened the review to adopt an intersectional approach.
