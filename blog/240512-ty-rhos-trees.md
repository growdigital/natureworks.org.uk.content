Went to see Aisha at [Ty Rhos Trees](https://tyrhostrees.wordpress.com/) on Saturday. We *supposed* to be picking up a few privet hedging plants. But we ended up with a black [Elder](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Sambucus+nigra) ([Sambucus nigra 'Black Beauty'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/135880/sambucus-nigra-black-beauty-(pbr)/details)) for the patio (a fruiting native ornamental cultivar). And then I *had* to pick up a couple of [Alder Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Frangula+alnus) ([Frangula alnus](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.c18)) because they’re one of the best native hedging plants for wildlife and I just haven’t grown them at home before. And then the storms took down a couple of fence panels, so we’ve decided to grow a few [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) ([Viburnum opulus](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.m7d)) because, well, the native species is just **stunning** and way nicer than a fence panel. And then were some native [Bloodtwig Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+sanguinea) ([Cornus sanguinea](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.f5s)) and I have a soft spot for dogwoods, and again, never really grown it at home. So now, the makeshift nursery by the side of the drive is getting bigger. And the bill was a bit more than was originally planned.
