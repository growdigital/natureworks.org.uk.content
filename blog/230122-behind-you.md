During my more low-level tasks, in amongst the flower beds and on the cutting room floor, my mind will often race ahead on the complexities of the Nature & Climate Emergency. We went to the pantomime yesterday and the audience (mostly children) were chomping at the bit for the audience participation parts, and the slapstick humour. I left feeling buoyed up, with the realisation that _most people want to take part_ and that any local community project (eg a [Wildlife Allotment](https://natureworks.substack.com/p/wildlife-allotments)) needs to key into that.
