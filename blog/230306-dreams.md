I watched World War Z with my teenaged son the other night. The incredibly swift apocalyptic devastation and societal breakdown portrayed by the outbreak of a zombie virus was frightening. I really think cinema like this is a way for people to process what is coming down the line from the Nature and Climate Emergency. A massive issue is that ignoring what all the science points at leaves us in a very vulnerable place. Maybe zombie apocalypse movies will move us to create resilient, robust and local networked systems?
