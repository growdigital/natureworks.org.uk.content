With my new found enthusiasm for foraging, herbs and medicinal plants, I’m reading a book from my Mum’s gardening book collection that I inherited. It’s a pretty coffee table book called [English Herb Gardens](https://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Herb-Gardens-Guy-Cooper/dp/0847806898/) by Cooper, Taylor and Boursnell.

The problem I have is with the “English”. I know for a fact that there are herb gardens in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Indeed, my favourite local herb garden is at [Llanerchaeron](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/wales/llanerchaeron/visiting-the-walled-garden-at-llanerchaeron), This is a gorgeous walled garden just outside [Aberaeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberaeron), Ceredigion.

So why not **British** Herb Gardens? There’s no explanation and an awful lot of colonial assumption.
