The [2nd International Forest Garden / Food Forest Symposium is available online](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/presentations-2023/), totally free. Do have a look.

In the introduction, Martin Crawford says:

> “Do we design food forests to fit in to the existing economic model, which is deeply flawed? Or design them for maximum ecological resilience and assume the economic model will change in time?”

Thank you Martin for putting it so succintly.
