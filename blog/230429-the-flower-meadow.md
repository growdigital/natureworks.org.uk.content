On the way back from a site visit, I stopped off at [Penrhiwpal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrhiwpal) to say hello to Sara at [The Flower Meadow](https://www.theflowermeadow.co.uk/). They offer seasonal British flowers, mostly for weddings. It was a real treat to have a quick look at the growing space, great long beds mostly of perennial flowers, in a real mix of species scattered throughout. There is also an annual bed _and_ a wild flower meadow.

Sara has a function room for hire as well, so I am seriously considering starting up forest garden workshops again because itâ€™s such a nice space.
