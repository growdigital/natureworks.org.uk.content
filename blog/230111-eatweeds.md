I actually managed to get some gardening done after days of writing and filming. 

It was just me and the trees and the plants and I was very happy. I am planting up some edibles in the Woodland Beds in the photo; probably a couple of Blueberrys, some rhubarb, herbs and some woodland plants. All very exciting.

Today’s major find was [Robin Harford](https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/about)’s [Eatweeds podcast](https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/podcast). I listened to the first 2 episodes, about a wild food chef, which comfrey you can eat ([Symphytum officinale](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale) btw), building relationships with plants & more. Highly recommended.
