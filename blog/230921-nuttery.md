My vision for a resilient community garden is a wildlife allotment, a covered social space, and a community orchard, which includes nut trees and edible shrubs. I have started researching nutteries in the UK, there only seems to be 2 marked on Google Maps (and [one in Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/CloontuskertTidyTowns)). 

The two are [Smallcombe Nuttery](https://transitionbath.org/project/community-gardening/) managed by [Transition Bath](https://transitionbath.org/), and [The Nuttery in Newnham](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCKt4VZoJaHrhXPL8), which appears to be a community garden.

I will keep looking. If you know of any nutteries, community or commercial, do let me know.
