I tried to get some work via Bark.com, for a local builder who wanted a garden designing so he could sell the house. I thought carefully about how to pitch it, and went with a traditional (for here) garden with heather and shrubs, thinking how you _could_ make a wildlife edible garden, just in a different style. This is what he said:

> This is not the type I want thanks 

Firstly, big kudos for actually replying. The vast majority of people don’t bother, maybe 80%? And then saying thank you. And finally, I have learned a lesson, which is to **ask people what they want**.

I know enough now to create different “styles” (horrible word) but keep the wildlife habitat, native plant and edibles ethic going.
