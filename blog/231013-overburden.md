[Syra](https://grwd.uk/syra/) is a woodland forest garden project on the west facing side of a Carmarthenshire hill. Matt and Marley from [West Wales Trails](www.westwalestrails.co.uk) are creating footpaths & seating areas, for access and management. 

I was asking Matt about a cheap alternative to [sub-base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subbase_(pavement)) for the self-binding gravel I’ll be using in the [Primary](https://grwd.uk/primary/) school wildlife forest garden. 

The problem with using [hardcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_aggregate) from builders rubble is that it can contain all sorts of aggregate. Matt suggested asking local quarries for **overburden**, the earth _around_ the edge of the material being quarried. They might even [grade](https://constructionhow.com/gradation-of-aggregate/) it.

Footnote: I’m not a big fan of mining generally but if there’s a way to use existing “waste” material, then I’m all for it.
