Conscious I haven’t been blogging every day, so will be posting whatever comes up. A couple of days ago, I came across the NBN Atlas, which is a map of species across the UK. Put your postcode and see what animal, vegetable or fungi is living in your area. That really is amazing.

Also, in reading an ecology report for a forest garden design job I’m working (it’s a [One Planet Development](https://www.gov.wales/one-planet-development-practice-guidance) so has to have a report), I came across this paper [Horizon-scanning for invasive non-native plants in Great Britain](http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015) and also [Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act!](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/schedule/9), about invasive plant species. A few forest garden plants in there too.
