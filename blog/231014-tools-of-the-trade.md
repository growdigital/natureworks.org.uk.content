### Most used & favourite

1. [Felco 2 secateurs](https://felco.com/en_gb/products/pruning-shears/felco-2) with [Housolution polyurethane sheath](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Housolution-Premium-Protective-Scabbard-Gardening/dp/B087JG433W)
2. [Silky F180 folding saw](http://www.silkyfox.co.uk/f180.php), with [replaceable blade](https://www.benburgess.co.uk/shop/silky-f180-folding-saw/)
3. [Niwaki hori-hori knife & canvas sheath](https://www.niwaki.com/hori-hori/#P00442-7)
3. [Showa 350R 10/XL gloves](https://www.showagroup.com/eu-en/shop/350r)
4. [Spear & Jackson solid socket tree spade](https://www.spear-and-jackson.com/products/hand-contractor-tools/contractors-tools/solid-socket-shovels/spear-jackson-solid-socket-7)

### Wishlist

1. [Silky Zubat 330](http://www.silkyfox.co.uk/zubat.php) with [belt clip scabbard](https://www.benburgess.co.uk/shop/silky-belt-clip-scabbard/)
2. [Niwaki GR Pro secateurs](https://www.niwaki.com/gr-pro-secateurs/#P00440-1) — I like Felco secateurs as they’re easy to take apart and maintain, **but** I don’t like the latch by the blades, much prefer a latch at the bottom of the handles like on the Niwaki secateurs.

### Rudimentary

1. **Path marking** — 50cm bamboo canes combined with [cotton butcher’s twine](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-butchers-twine-4172495) are ideal, because they’re easy to adjust and tighten, and they’re compostable. If you have access to make your own bamboo canes from a local clump, even better, because they are local, free and also will compost down even quicker.
2. **Tree diameter** — to quickly calculate the diameter of trees, I use a 2 metre bamboo cane, marked at half metre intervals with black gaffa tape. You can see how far an 8m diameter tree extends very easily.
3. **Hedge spacing** — for the line of the hedge, use bamboo cane to measure from a fixed point, eg the edge of a path, allowing for the final diameter of the hedging plant. It’s good to plant about 0.5m apart, depending on species, budget etc. Mark 0.5m on the bamboo cane.
4. **Tree marking** — bamboo cane & [dead hedge](/dead-hedge/). If you can see your trees easily, you can make your way to look after them more easily too.
