Ain’t no denying it, we are truly in a Nature and Climate Emergency. Well, there are plenty of people denying it. Whatever we do, there will be radical change. Far better to be the agents of change, in a positive way. But there is not the political will. 

What there will be is **classes**, lots of wildlife, food forest, garden design classes. I have planned **fifteen**, and have so far made **one**. I have made a new page for them, with a rather splendid table: [natureworks.org.uk/classes](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/classes/)

Gardening is fulfilling on a number of different levels:

* Connects people to our nature
* Connects people to their food & landscape
* Good for physical and mental health
* Can be sociable & strengthen community 
* Provides habitat & food for wildlife

In permaculture design, this is called [stacking functions](https://redemptionpermaculture.com/integrate-dont-segregate-stacking-functions-in-permaculture/), where an element has more than one function.

I’d like to explore different facets of creating a forest garden with small, 1 hour long, online classes. My best selling course, [The Backyard Forest](https://store.natureworks.org.uk/l/BackyardForest), is great but it is a bit on the dense and chunky side, about 3¾ hours in total. I think classes will be easier to complete, and also easier to keep up-to-date.
