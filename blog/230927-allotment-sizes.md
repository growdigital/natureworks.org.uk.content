Just a quick note to myself, according to [The National Allotment Society](https://www.nsalg.org.uk/allotment-info/), a UK allotment is 10 [poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit)), which is 250m².

* Full: 250m², approx 16m x 16m
* Half: 125m², approx 11m x 11m
* Quarter: 63m², approx 8m x 8m
