I bought a drone for photos of garden plans. Originally I thought a drone would only be useful for large gardens but I really think it’ll be an invaluable way of documenting planting plans.

Because any garden with a curve (which in my book should be every garden) is actually quite hard to represent in a CAD planting plan. This is my CAD plan for the [Clifftop Garden](https://natureworks.org.uk/portfolio/clifftop):

And this is how it worked out, with photos stitched together:

Quite a big difference in dimensions and proportions. I think.

With a drone, I can take a photo of the land before, and use that as the basis for the CAD plan. And then take a photo of the garden once it’s planted up, and use that as the basis for the final planting plan for the client. I’m even toying with putting a version online, using something like [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/), so that the client can edit the plan.

Here’s the small [Max Garden](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/portfolio/max/), showing the photo montage used as the basis for the planting plan:
