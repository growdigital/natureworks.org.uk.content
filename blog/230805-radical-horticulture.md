I read [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com/)‚Äôs [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/books/n/a-new-garden-ethic) a few years ago (it‚Äôs brililant, have a read), and he continues joining up the dots between society, politics, economics and gardening with native plants.

His latest blog is called [On Rabbits And Salad Bars in Suburbia](https://www.monarchgard.com/thedeepmiddle/on-rabbits-and-salad-bars-in-suburbia):

> Ready for a radical thought? It's not damage. It's nature. It's an animal using a plant to survive, and the plant was designed to be eaten.

It‚Äôs not really that radical, is it. Is it?! I‚Äôve been describing forest gardens as edible ecosystems for a while now. Building up species diversity is a huge part of that.

> We are trying to create an ecosystem, after all, to try and restore some balance up and down trophic levels, and provide a bit of habitat. 

Well, maybe it _is_ a radical proposition for Trad Hort‚Ñ¢ after all. So I propose, a new HashTag [#RadicalHorticulture](https://mas.to/@natureworks/110825909672814653). Thank you, Benjamin üôè
