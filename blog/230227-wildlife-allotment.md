I first saw My Wildlife Allotment on BBC Gardeners World a couple of years ago, and was impressed then with the visual richness of the allotment. Then a couple of days ago, Nadine posted a lovely photo of a Cornus mas in flower, and I realised that it needs a pollinating partner (_why_ didn’t I check this when planting the solitary specimen?!). 

And _then_ I realised that Wildlife Allotment is **exactly** what I am calling the community forest garden project, as it’s based around individual plots, surrounded with a community orcchard and native plants and wild flowers, with an incentive to use perennial vegetables.

Nadine is way more of a plantsperson than me, she has an [amazing looking blog on Hardy Plant Society](https://www.hardy-plant.org.uk/blog/nadine) which I’ve started reading. Loads of ornamentals and non-natives that aren’t really my thing _but_ starting out with wildlife and habitat as the basis.

She also has a [Blogspot blog](https://mywildlifeallotment.blogspot.com/) as well. And a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MyWildlifeAllotment)!
