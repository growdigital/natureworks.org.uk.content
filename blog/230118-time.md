I am just putting finishing touches to the CAD for Gardeners online class. Just to say, captions take _ages_, so I’m updating my time estimate for creating a 1 hour class:

* Writing: 2 days
* Filming: 1 day
* Editing: 3 days
* Subtitles: 1 day
* Export & upload: 1 day

8 days for a 1 hour class!! Essentially, that’s two weeks.

This info really is for my own benefit.
