Work continues on the wildlife food forest, albeit slowly, at my local primary school. I was going to mock up the gabion baskets for the horseshoe enclosure, using bits of bamboo. But I ran out of time, so instead took down the apple trees.

There are 3 varieties, all on dwarfing M26 rootstock, so they won’t grow more than 2 metres tall. The varieties are:

* ['Greensleeves'](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/greensleeves)
* ['Fiesta'](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/fiesta)
* ['Lord Lambourne'](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/lord-lambourne)

I talked to the members of the Eco-council about grafting and rootstocks. And botanical binomial names. Yes, it’s a primary school but they seemed to take it in!

I was going to plant them out _but_ we discovered last week that there’s an old playground about 10cm beneath the top soil, beneath a layer of weed fabric. My guess is that the fabric was put down with a thick layer of wood chip, which has slowly turned into soil.

The next session will be the mock bamboo gabions, which will give a better idea of volume and position.
