Yesterday I was at the edge of the [Cotswolds](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1676366654/thatched/house-230213.jpg), with a new forest garden project. It is an amazing place, with a sheep dip stream running on the south boundary, and then in front of the house, with a stone dipping circle.

It’s a half acre mature ornamental garden, with a lot of big rhodedendron, skimmias, symphoricarpos etc This does mean there is likely acid soil.

I’ll be writing up a plan of action for the site as a whole, with ideas for areas, hedging, paths and circulation (and costs!) and then suggesting plants the veg growing area.
