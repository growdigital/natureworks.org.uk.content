I had been learning Welsh using [SaySomethingIn.com](https://www.saysomethingin.com/en/learn-welsh/), the language learning system was a small amount of spoken Welsh every day, so that you eventually start speaking without thinking, and you learn the writing later. [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/) have something similar.

And because of my son’s new-found interest in music, I’m learning the basics of the free digital audio workstation [LMMS](https://lmms.io/), using the two dozen 10 minute [YouTube videos by TJ Free](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M).

I had planned for my [forest garden design classes](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/classes/) to be about an hour (my original course is 3 hours 45 minutes!) but maybe I should be looking at a small, regular format? Something you can watch every day in 10 minute chunks? A condensed course of 20 x 10 minute chunky classes?
