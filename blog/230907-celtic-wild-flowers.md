I picked up some [Hemp Agrimony](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Eupatorium+cannabinum) and [Betony](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Stachys+officinalis) today for clients from [Celtic Wild Flowers](https://celticwildflowers.co.uk/). They are lovely people who work there and I just adore being surrounded by native plants.

There is a new cafe next door for the pet charity, and they are just off the M4 motorway, so please do go and pay them a visit.
