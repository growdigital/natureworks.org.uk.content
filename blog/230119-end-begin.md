I was going to write about a [permaculture musings](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-01-17/permaculture-musings/) post I read, which talks about design and colonialism. I donâ€™t think I will now, as my brain is fried from too much CAD.

Yes, I have finished the [CAD for Gardeners](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/classes/cad/) course. I have uploaded it to Gumroad and also to Udemy. And I have made graphics and put it in a newsletter. I am tired of CAD now already, I want to get back into the garden.

Onward!
