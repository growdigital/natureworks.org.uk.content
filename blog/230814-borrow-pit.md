I went out to the [Syra](https://grwd.uk/syra/) project the other day (2 acre south west facing forest garden on steepish slope), and I spoke with Matt from [West Wales Trails](www.westwalestrails.co.uk) who is landscaping the paths. 

One of the key structural elements in any garden is paths, they form the shape of the garden and enable access to plants and features.

It was great to discuss different aspects of landscaping from a different perspective (Matt mostly does mountain bike tracks). And I learned about borrow pits: heâ€™s going to dig a hole to the shaley/clay subsoil, remove that and use it on top of the levelled seating areas, then fill the pit with other stuff.
