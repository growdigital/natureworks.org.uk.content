For bleeding edge words and acronyms I now depend upon my teenage son. I am too tired for TV, too old for gaming.

“OP” stands for Over-Powered. Back in the day, I played [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)) (II if you’re asking). Those times when you collected all the armour, weapons and health. **That** is the feeling of OP. And then I looked for the other players, and my gameplay wasn’t all that.

What the hell has this got to do with gardening? Well, I have _dozens_ of garden projects under my belt (a dozen on my [portfolio page](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/portfolio/)). I have a wide-ranging knowledge of [forest garden plants](https://store.natureworks.org.uk/l/ForestGardenSpreadsheet), an ever increasing knowledge of [native plants](https://bit.ly/garden-wild-spreadsheet) and ornamentals. I am skilled at surveying, adept at [designing](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/design), a [whizz with CAD](https://store.natureworks.org.uk/l/cad). A good communicator (every single client gets their own project page eg [Clifftop](https://grwd.uk/clifftop/)). I am garden designer.

**I AM OP.**

But where the hell is the work?!

_This_ is where the gameplay comes in. Using all those skills to best effect and maximum leverage. _This_ is what I need to work on.
