I’m keeping on with my YouTube [Garden Wild Flowers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3tnDlJcXMk8LbHKfpY5k8KQyEMNq4jVd) series, today was the turn of [Bugle (Ajuga reptans)](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ajuga+reptans), just a short [7 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/live/FPCQ775MWgY). 

I’m flat out with creating my new [online classes](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/classes/), so it’s really nice to just be exploring UK native wild flowers, and how they can fit within a wildlife forest garden. It will take a lot to shift the horticultural industry toward natives _but_ putting out resources for gardeners is a good way to start.

I’ve also been using [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)) a whole load more, I really enjoy it, the internet without any advertising. I also use it a lot to bookmark threads of ideas, in combination with this blog, such as the [Garden Wild Flower thread](https://mas.to/@natureworks/109614896262263565). Keeps it all in one place :)
