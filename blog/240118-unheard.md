I went to a 3 hour workshop yesterday, [Workshop on Hearing Unheard Voices: Listening to future generations and nonhuman nature in Climate Assemblies](https://knoca.eu/event/workshop-on-hearing-unheard-voices/). [KNOCA](https://knoca.eu/about-us/) is the Knowledge Network on Climate Assemblies, and I’m interested from the perspective of the [Hope Garden](https://hopegarden.uk), how to represent future generations and non-human life in the decision making process.

Professor Tatsuyoshi Saijo from [Kochi University](http://www.souken.kochi-tech.ac.jp/seido/en/index.html) gave a very inspirational talk about Future Design. How do we take into account future generations in decision making processes? Here’s an [article about him in Vox](https://www.vox.com/23870374/tatsuyoshi-saijo-economist-research-institute-for-future-design-future-perfect-50-2023). And a short video about Future Design:

On Tuesday 16th I went to a [Biodiversity Collage](https://www.fresquedelabiodiversite.org/en.html#first-section) -- this is a method of mutally exploring issues surrounding biodiversity using a similar methodology to a [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/). Thank you Jen for the invite!
