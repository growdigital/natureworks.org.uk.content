I listened to an old [Robin Harford](https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/)’s [EatWeeds podcast](https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/podcast) episode with [Miles Irving](https://www.milesirving.com/) (very strangely, I can’t find the episode on the website) and I am starting to put together the idea of foraging in your own forest garden. [Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall](https://www.rivercottage.net/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall) mentioned this I think in a preface to a Martin Crawford book? 

And it also ties me into thinking about [Kat Anderson](https://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/people/m-anderson)’s deeply influential book [Tending the Wild](https://archive.org/details/tendingwildnativ0000ande), about indigenous Californian people’s relationship with the land. 

And then I saw this quote from a [Caitlin Johnstone](https://caityjohnstone.medium.com/) article [We’ve Been Dominated By Narrative Control Since The Dawn Of Civilization
](https://caityjohnstone.medium.com/weve-been-dominated-by-narrative-control-since-the-dawn-of-civilization-c40e95976e86):

> That all changed with the invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Once humans began learning to trick the Earth’s biosphere into making the food appear next to them, they became capable of sticking around in one place without starving, and civilizations began to emerge. 

I’m not so sure, I don’t know if you can call the indigenous American way of living **agriculture** per se? It feels more like foraging a forest garden at a landscape scale. Will have an investigate and a think.
