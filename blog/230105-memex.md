I read the most amazing blog post by [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/) about blogging, called [The Memex Method](https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46). 

Essentially, he blogs every day, using tags so that he can search his own writing and develop ideas.

Originally, I was blogging solely about gardening. Now, I want to branch out and write about diverse yet related topics (philosophy, politics, economics; heck, could start a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_politics_and_economics) with all that). 

So, this is the start of that. The aim here is not ready-made, polished pieces. It is small nuggets of interest, that may somehow join up with each other.

For starters, I can recommend two writers on the publishing platform [Substack](https://substack.com):

1. Antonia Malachik [antonia.substack.com](https://antonia.substack.com) — she writes about the Commons, ownership, land, walking etc
2. Alex Steffen, The Snap Forward [alexsteffen.substack.com](https://alexsteffen.substack.com) — he writes about climate resilience and the uncertainty facing us all

And did you know that [commoning](https://david-bollier.simplecast.com/) is a thing (Frontiers of Commoning, with David Bollier)?! And [Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org/) exist?

Enough already, see you tomorrow.
