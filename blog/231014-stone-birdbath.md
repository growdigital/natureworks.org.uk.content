I was reading about birdbaths in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/climate/birdbath-heat-climate.html) (warning: paywall). TL;DR a heavy, shallow bird bath is good, near a hose so you can wash it and fill it up regularly and easily.

I was wondering about how to make a stone birdbath, rather than buying yet more concrete, and it is quite doable. This is the first video I found, on [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/yards/23044696/stone-bird-bath). The bit I’m interested in this bath itself, not the stand, so fast forward to 5'50".

Now to find a friendly, local stone mason…
