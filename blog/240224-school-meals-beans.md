[Hodmedodâ€™s](https://hodmedods.co.uk/) grow UK grain and pulses, and they are doing a **lot** of what I consider essential work in food security & sovereignty, soil preservation, education and health. Also, check out their [recipes section](https://hodmedods.co.uk/blogs/recipes).

They have a [great newsletter](https://hodmedods.co.uk/pages/newsletter), in which I saw the blog post [How to transform school meals? Beans is how!](https://hodmedods.co.uk/blogs/news/how-to-transform-school-meals-beans-is-how) about chef James Taylor working to transform school meals at two London primary schools. What is evident is that it is a long haul, and also of the importance of trailblazing campaigns such as his.
