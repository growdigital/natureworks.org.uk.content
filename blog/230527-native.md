I saw a [toot on Mastodon by Helen Graham](https://mas.to/@HelenGraham@mastodon.world/110428906331270271) which talked about growing native fungi in a garden “Fungi are more vital to healthy ecosystems and life on earth  than pollinators but totally ignored”.

We concentrate on native wild flowers for pollinators but how about we look to grow native fungi, ferns, grasses and forbs? A full stack native garden so to speak, including a whole new [kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) by design.

When I floated this idea, a friend of mine countered with whether that isn’t just nature? 

I think this is a fascinating question, and I would say no, because a garden is **a designed space**. Paths, features, spaces, habitat, plants, fungi.
