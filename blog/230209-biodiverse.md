For a long time, I’ve been singing the praises of the [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx). It is truly amazing, what inverterbrates eat which UK plant. An invaluable resource for wildlife gardening, and I have a reference for it on my [UK wild flower spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/garden-wild-spreadsheet).

And then someone put me on to [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org/), the National Biodiversity Network Atlas. A list of all species of plants, fungi and animals in the UK and their location. Incredible.

To be followed hot on the heels by news of [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), the Global Diversity Information Facility. Global species. Wow. I’ve only had a quick look but, wow.

I mentioned this to an ornamental friend, and how much these resources could be used by gardeners. Incredible amount of cross-disciplinary potential.
