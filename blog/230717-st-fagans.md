I was planning a big blog post but time says otherwise. So I shall make do with jotting down some ideas. 

The idea was that there is so much history of decent garden and interior space design. [St Fagans Museum](https://museum.wales/stfagans/about/) in Cardiff has plenty of examples. I was speaking to a client about it the other day, and I would love to make a trip and find out more from the very knowledgable guides.

This is part of the email, here for reminding myself to do the research!

> There are four really interesting examples of interesting context gardens. The miners cottages each have layout content and varieties that are period appropriate to the cottage as presented. There is a proper farm garden and orchard dynamic at the Red Kennixton farmhouse. The half timbered Anernodwydd farmhouse has a very dynamic 17th century farm garden. But best of all is the thatched Nantwallter cottage which has reconstructed two metre convex bed vegetable gardening and a herb/medicinal garden by the door. Also a very interesting but less gardening related stone pigsty with built in hen house. 

Marvellous stuff.
