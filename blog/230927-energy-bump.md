I sketched this graph a few years ago, to illustrate to a client that maintaining grass is high energy, either with a machine or a scythe. But it is **easy**, as in everybody knows how to mow a lawn.

To move the grass to a different state requires a bump of energy. If it’s a traditional veg garden, it will require **constant** weeding to allow the annual veg to grow. If it’s a forest garden with perennial veg, then longer term it is way less energy than either annual veg or grass. But it does take time, a good two years or more for the ground cover and perennials to get established, which means two years of discriminate weeding.

And then there is the _cultural_ energy bump, which is a whole other thing!
