The news is filled with stories from the Nature & Climate Emergency. [Extreme flooding in Italy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65632655), [a heatwave in Southeast Asia](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/05/17/south-east-asia-is-in-the-grip-of-a-record-breaking-heatwave), a warning that we will [reach 1.5°C by 2027](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2373653-breaching-1-5c-of-global-warming-by-2027-is-increasingly-likely/), [extreme temperatures in the Arctic](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/weather/topstories/climate-change-arctic-greening-is-accelerating-global-warming-in-more-ways-than-one-professor-isla-myers-smith/ar-AA1aTkAs).

There is no political appetite from governments to systemic change, which is what is required. 

Which means we will have unmanaged systemic change and spiralling temperature increases to 4-5°C.

So, what do we do? What does climate resilience look like in society?
