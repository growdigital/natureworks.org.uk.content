Long day filming and making finishing touches to my CAD for Gardeners online course. The slides are freely available online [natureworks.org.uk/class/cad](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/class/cad/) and I’ll be editing the video over the next couple of days with [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/), the most amazing free software editing package.

Then off to a Cadernid Emlyn Resilience group meeting in the local pub. I’m keen to get the town allotments project off the ground, so it was very good to meet local, motivated people.
