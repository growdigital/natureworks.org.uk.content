[Linden Hawthorne](https://twitter.com/Haggewoods) is a hero of mine, she regularly posts Twitter threads detailing the inverterbrates and their relationship with specific native plants. She’s written a paper about the [beauty and utility of Natural Latin](https://naturallatin.com/2020/05/15/singing-the-praises-of-natural-latin/), and has said:

> I think of binomials as a two-word story 

Her use of the [Database of Insects and their Food](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx) and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to weave such insightful and inspirational threads is delightful.

When I first started out on my forest garden journey, I quickly settled in to using the Latin names, as they are so much precise, universal and descriptive. Using the example of Red Campion (Silene dioica), they’re pre-eminent in [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Silene+dioica), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silene_dioica) and the [Plant Atlas of British & Irish Flora](https://plantatlas.brc.ac.uk/plant/silene-dioica).

However, having learnt basic Welsh with [a ‘natural language’ method](https://www.saysomethingin.com/welsh), I find that it really helps me remembery by _saying_ the words out loud. 

I had heard that there is no correct way to pronounce Latin, as there are no living speakers. However, surely if it’s so closely related to the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages), then there must be _some_ sense of how you would speak it. And then I find [Google Translate](https://translate.google.co.uk/). They may be an evil data-scraping corporation but it is a handy tool.

It does sound incredibly Italian to my ears but at last I’m prepared to try my hand in public at [Silene dioica](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=la&tl=en&text=silene%20dioica&op=translate), [Gallium aparine](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=la&tl=en&text=Gallium%20aparine&op=translate), even [Crataegus monogyna](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=la&tl=en&text=crataegus%20monogyna&op=translate)! 

Obviously, I could be wrong and Google Translate might well be a travesty, would be great to get some feedback from people who know what they’re talking about 😆
