I am building a website for the [Hope Garden](https://hopegarden.uk) project, “A Climate Assembly at the heart of a wildlife forest garden 💚”. There are _lots_ of working parts in any website, and it takes a not inconsiderable amount of time. My reasoning to do it is to a) make everything public, for reference for within the group and for publicity and b) as a testing ground, to write and sketch ideas out to see how they work.

There’s a blog, a [newsletter](https://hopegarden.beehiiv.com), a contact form, various icons, an [about](https://hopegarden.uk/about) page etc. I haven’t even started on the plants yet. 

This is pretty much the same process for _any_ website, whether it’s for a group of far-right neo-nazis or for climate justice campaigners. What matters is the **intent**. 

And our intent is to reboot democracy, focus horticultural minds on creating nature-friendly, resilient gardens and promote the idea of sustainable edible crops.
