What is a wood meadow? 

Well, at its simplest, it‚Äôs roughly 40% mown meadow and 60% stands of trees and shrubs. 

What about a wood meadow **caf√©**? Imagine, somewhere to sit, decent coffee ‚òï & cake üç∞, parking, toilets. And imagine the meadow stretched out before you, with wide mown grass paths curving through the long, flower-studded grass, surrounded by impenetrable hedges. And you can let the children run around, safe yet immersed. Multi-use, multi-generational, supporting sustainable livelihoods.

Who wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the wood meadow caf√©? 

Idea originally on my [fundraiser page](https://ko-fi.com/natureworks/goal?g=37) for my trip to see Estonian wood meadows for real.
