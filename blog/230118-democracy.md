On Monday 16 January, I went to a 1.5 hour Zoom talk and discussion about a participatory democracy project run by an organisation called [Gwyrddni](https://www.gwyrddni.cymru/en/) (translates as Green Us I think).

Neoliberals and fascists are very bad for people and the environment. Participatory democracy, where a representative selection of local people are given the information and tools to make informed decisions, I see as a counterpoint to the Media Cult of the Individual and the lobbying power of corporations.

It reminds me a of a sci-fi story I read when I was about 10, called [Franchise](https://archive.org/details/1955-08_IF/).

Forest gardens are great, wildlife gardening is great but we also need to look at proper engagement and support across communities, and participatory democracy is a really interesting way to bring that about. Imagine if resources were allocated democratically ðŸ¤”
