I am not sure why but I want to write a book. A book about gardening for the climate emergency. I half-jokingly [coined the phrase “radical horticulture”](https://mas.to/deck/@natureworks/111029901830439022), because really, it’s not that radical (working with nature, perennial edibles, native plants where possible, vegan, organic) and really is just a compilation of all the best practises and ideas that I’ve come across in my forest gardening journey these past few years.

So, how about Radical Horticulture - The Book? How do we garden for the climate emergency? There are great economic and social inequalities and rifts, and how can gardens be carved out as a positive and hopeful space in the underbelly of the relentless doom leviathan?

My Dad was an architect, and I am uncomfortably aware of the post-war idealism of a modern built environment to solve Man’s (sic) ills, worthy design handed down from the experts for the masses.

There is a phrase doing the [third sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_sector) rounds called “co-design”. I am wary of catchphrases and zeitgeist words but I do think actually _involving_ people affected _in the design & build process_ is a darned fine idea.

This is where the [Hope Garden](https://grwd.uk/hope/) project is centred: a wildlife forest garden with a [Communit Assembly](https://extinctionrebellion.uk/act-now/resources/peoples-assemblies/) at its heart.

And this, I think, is where Radical Horticulture is different, because it isn’t a form, it isn’t a style, it is some simple guidelines melded with a transparent and socially equitable process.
