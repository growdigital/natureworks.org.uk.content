I came across the [Bulletin of Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/) today, with a rather sombre article [Faster than forecast, climate impacts trigger tipping points in the Earth system](https://thebulletin.org/2023/04/faster-than-forecast-climate-impacts-trigger-tipping-points-in-the-earth-system/#post-heading). 

We are locked in to 2-3°C and we need political and economic system change to dramatically reduce carbon emissions.

Back at home, my forest garden is my therapy, I’m growing a range of crops and creating a host of habitat. Dead hedges are very handy in the early stages of a forest garden, as they provide shelter for young trees before planted windbreaks get established. They’re also a great home for many different invertebrates. And they somewhere to put all your prunings, brambles and dock roots.

Today, I was retrofitting a dead hedge for an Arnold Hawthorn. I was also doing some very late, emergency pruning on a Bramley apple. Yes, I know, very late. But better late than never, so now at least the apples won’t be breaking any too long branches.
