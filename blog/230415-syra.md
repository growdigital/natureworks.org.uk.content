I’ve had a lovely little design job come up, a south-west facing, steeply sloping woodland garden. The bramble has mostly been cleared, and I’ve been designing in-situ, rather than measuring up and creating a design in CAD. 

The job is just marking out paths, trees and windbreaks at the moment, so quite broad strokes at this stage, laying out the structure. Because it’s on a slope, and because the paths are all curved around existing plants, it’s _way_ easier to design with twine and bamboo than it is to measure accurately.

This does mean that I‘ve had to document the areas and plants using video:

But videos are quite long-winded and who wants to listen to me for 9 minutes and 58 seconds? I sure as hell don’t. The best way round this is to use a drone, you can pick one up second hand for a couple of hundred quid, and you could take a photo of the whole garden and mark up plants for the client.

To be honest, it has actually been a really nice way of working. And the clients are lovely, _and_ they make cairns.
