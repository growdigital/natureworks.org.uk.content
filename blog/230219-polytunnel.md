We grow [Cape Gooseberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Physalis+peruviana) (the most excellent jam), [Yacon](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Polymnia+sonchifolia) (salads?) and [Chilean Guava](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ugni+molinae) (sweeties!) as perennials in the polytunnel, along with a grape vine and the annual tomatoes, peppers and chillies. 

Today I _finally_ managed to clear out last year’s growth, and harvested some Yacon tubers. 

Some people say you don’t need a compost bin with a forest garden but I say you most definitely do. There is a _huge_ amount of material, mostly Cape Gooseberry stalks, which I’ve piled on to our very much cold composting compost bins. Much easier than hot composting but you do need the space to be able to leave them for months and months.
