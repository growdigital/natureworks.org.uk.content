I finally finished editing the video today. So, just as a recap for myself, to produce a 1 hour online class (that’s video, slidehow, notes and resources) it takes:

* Writing: 2 days
* Filming: 1 day
* Editing: 3 days
* Export & subtitles: 1 day

7 whole days. For 1 hour.

The amazing news is that the video editor [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org) has built-in [subtitle creation](https://docs.kdenlive.org/en/effects_and_compositions/subtitle.html)! Heere’s a [handy video I found on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8s8HgFHnKQ), explaining it very clearly.

My next class is going to be the “overview“. This is the rousing battle-cry for wildlife forest gardeners around the world. This technical stuff is all very well, but there need’s to be a clear explanation, a purpose and then supply clear tools.
