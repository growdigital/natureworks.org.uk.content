As well as my (not so currently weekly) [Substack newsletter](/newsletter/), I also try to write these blogs every day and upload a couple of videos to YouTube every week.

I’m never sure how actually useful these videos are. Most of them, I make them as an aide de memoire for my clients' gardens, so that I know what I’ve planted where, and why as well.

But how useful are they? I have great thematic visions in my head about the role of wildlife & edible gardening in the rich mosaic of human activity, emphatically at a time of nature and climate emergency. But videos about fruit bushes? Eh?

Anyways, here’s the latest one:
