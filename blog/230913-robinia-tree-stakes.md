- From a 1941 USDA bulletin ““Worn-out farm field of about 6 acres planted with black locust 6 feet apart each way. Carlisle County, Ky. The trees are 25 to 35 feet in height at 8 years of age and making straight, valuable post timber.”

Very interesting to hear that [Black Locust](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Robinia+pseudoacacia) (Robinia pseudoacacia) can is long lasting (25 years) and very suitable for tree stakes. I currently have my eye on some Sweet Chestnut stakes.

Also, Martin is trialling some sheeps wool tree guards, which are compostable. Will post developments here.
