I post a [lot of photos](https://mas.to/deck/@natureworks/media) on my [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) account [@natureworks@mas.to](https://mas.to/@natureworks). I wondered if there was a way to notify ‘subscribers’ of when new photos were added.

If somebody likes or boosts your Mastodon post, when you [edit that post](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-edit-posts-in-mastodon/), they get a notification. So, by making the top of a Mastodon thread the “head” post, every time I add a photo, I edit the head post and people who boosted that post get a notification.

### Portfolio

So, as an example, here’s the head post for [my portfolio](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/portfolio/). 

[mas.to/@natureworks/111107512607853822](https://mas.to/@natureworks/111107512607853822)

If you have a Mastodon account and boost that, every time I add a photo, you’ll get a notification.

And here’s the Mastodon sub-thread for the Rhug garden:
