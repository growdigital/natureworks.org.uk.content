More noodling to streamline my publishing. Firstly, I’m using [Buffer](https://buffer.com) and [BulkBuffer](https://www.bulkbuffer.com/) to automate my social media posts across [Facebook](https://facebook.com/NatureWorksGarden), [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@natureworks) and [Google Maps Business](https://www.google.co.uk/search?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&output=search&q=Nature+Works+%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%A6&ludocid=13098850715541905055&gsas=1&lsig=AB86z5VkRa0eETkklPUi-Co_zuVR&ved=1i%3A4%2Ct%3A109124%2Ce%3A3%2Cp%3ALbaNY673Lo7gxc8P7r2dYA%3A134). I really don’t use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/natureworksgdn) any more, which is a shame but it is a hellsite.

Secondly, I have my [blog posts](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/blog/) news feed ([RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed) connected to my Facebook page using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore). It’s all a bit handmade, as I have customised [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website. But hopefully it works, and it means I can concentrate on gardening and writing.
