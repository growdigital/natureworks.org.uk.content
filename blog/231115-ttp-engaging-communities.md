I have started the [Trust The People](https://www.trustthepeople.earth/) free [Community Assembly course](https://www.trustthepeople.earth/the-course).

The second workshop on Monday 13th November was Engaging Communities. Just for reference, he is my feedback:

## Universe of obligation

* I was struck by the _fluidity_ of the relationships. The boundaries between and within the 3 circles aren't static, and it feels as though your obligations shift according to the needs of those who you have contact with, and your own needs as well. 
* The exercise is quite anthropocentric. How much obligation do we have to other living creatures and ecosystems? Interesting to [compare between anthropocentrism, biocentrism and ecocentrism](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/talks/intersectional/#14) 
* Wales has a [Wellbeing of Future Generations Act](https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/), which firmly places an obligation on public bodies to consider future generations in policy 
* I love this quote in relation to obligation: 

> “Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach”<br>_~ Clarissa Pinkola Estés_

## Active listening exercise

Might help with the exercise to say that the observer needs to keep time for 3.5 minutes
