I bought a [DJI Mini 2 SE](https://www.dji.com/uk/mini-2-se) drone to take photos of gardens, so that I can more easily create garden designs and planting plans.

The [Tir](https://grwd.uk/tir/) Garden project is the droneâ€™s first big outing, and I really noticed the distortion from the point-of-view and the lens, when compared to the satellite photo. I kind of expected this but it is marked.

The way round it is to create an [orthomosaic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_survey): lots of photos stitched together. This droneblog post discusses [Can the DJI Mini 2 Be Used for Mapping?](https://www.droneblog.com/dji-mini-2-mapping/). There is open source software to create such a map, called [WebODM](https://www.opendronemap.org/webodm/) and here are the [Linux installation instructions](https://docs.opendronemap.org/installation/#linux).

To take the photos on a pre-planned route, there is Android/iOS software called [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/).
