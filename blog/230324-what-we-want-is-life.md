I did a bit of work for the neighbour of a client, weeding and mulching. It’s a new build cul-de-sac, large amounts of tarmac, gravel, artificial grass and not that many plants. The neighbour commented on how they missed the birdsong and the wildlife of their old, established garden. 

This really brought home to me that it’s the **aliveness** of the garden that is important. Yes, people need to be welcome and take part in the garden, but it really needs to be **alive**. _This_ is why I bang on about native plants, wild flowers, wildlife habitat, edible crops, organic, peat free.

Does it support life? No? Then change it so it does!
