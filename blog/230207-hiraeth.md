Very busy couple of days, yesterday marked up the [Primary](https://grwd.uk/primary) school project with a labyrinth outline and seating area. The kids were great, interested and engaged. I use butchers twine as it’s not plastic, and some metal landscape pegs as my supply of bamboo sticks has dried up. I’ll write up some notes and photos separately.

The big event for today was a site visit to a new project, 5½ acre field, south east sloping, woodland and spring below. It’s up high, and **windbreak hedges** are the order of the day. Client has _lots_ of ideas about different projects and approaches, which is always a blessing. At this stage, really important to keep options open whilst still deciding on direction and structure. A balancing act. 

And the name for the project is **hiraeth**, which is a beautiful Welsh word that roughly translates to **longing**.

Oh, and I made a short video:
