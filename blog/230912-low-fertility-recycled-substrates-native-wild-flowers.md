I’m a big fan of [John Little](https://www.tiktok.com/@grassroofco)’s work on creating wildlife habitat diversity using recycled building “waste”. 

I have a possible garden project, where the builder has cleared some rooms to be replastered and refitted, and the leftover building material has been left outside. 

[Celtic Wild Flowers](https://celticwildflowers.co.uk/) is a brilliant native plant nursery in Swansea, Wales. I found out today that Barry is a big proponent of using [coal slag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinker_(waste)) as a low fertility substrate. There is lots of it in South Wales!

I am really keen to know which plants will thrive in which substrate. Currently, I’ve only trialled growing [Thymus serpyllum](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.cmt) on crushed concrete, which does very well.
