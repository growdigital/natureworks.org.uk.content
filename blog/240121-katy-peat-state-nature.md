I went to a great [Ceredigion Nature Partnership](https://connectceredigion.org.uk/ceredigion-local-nature-partnership) online meeting last week. Dr Katy Peat had made a summary of the [State of Nature](https://stateofnature.org.uk/) [2023 report](https://stateofnature.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP25999-State-of-Nature-main-report_2023_FULL-DOC-v12.pdf).
