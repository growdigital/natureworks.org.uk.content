Ivy ([Hedera helix](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.95p1tn)) is a fantastic wildlife plant (supporting over [106 species of insect](https://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=2563), as evergreen habitat, for its flowers and its berries. I saw this on a wall in the village, taking Ronnie Barker out for a walk.

You do need to be careful, the wall has to be well laid, otherwise the roots will find their way into the crevices and destabilise the wall. I was wondering how well it would climb up a chain link fence ðŸ¤”
