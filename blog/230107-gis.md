GIS stands for [Geographic Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), software that can analyse data that has a geographic component.

I cam across it a while back, when I was looking at alternatives to using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) for garden deign, I even met a GIS developer at the [GovCampCymru unconference 2022](https://www.govcamp.cymru/). I settled on [QCAD](https://qcad.org) and I really haven't looked back since.

GIS cropped up again when I posted a [Mastodon summary](https://mas.to/@natureworks/109644748254559747) of my new [CAD for Gardeners](/class/cad/) class, and someone said “why not GIS?”.  The main reason is **complexity**. 2D CAD has a steep enough learning curve, and really, for garden design the core functionality is plant spacing & plant quantities. GIS looks amazing (not that I’ve read up on it) but is probably overkill.

_However_, it would be good for larger scale projects. I am thinking about large scale ecological restoration, and if you could have data on eg native plant distributions across a large area, that could feed into design decisions. Possibly some sort of Citizen Science and Citizen Gardener project?
