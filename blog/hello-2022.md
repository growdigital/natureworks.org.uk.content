Greetings and welcome. I have had a long time away from blogging, and I have resolved (always dangerous at this time of year) to start up again. 

Apparently, [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_pratchett) only wrote **400** words a day. But he wrote **every day**.

I’m not promising that I’ll write every day but I aiming to put some thoughts down once a week. 

For this year, my focus is going to be on working as a [wildlife, food forest garden designer](https://natureworks.org.uk/design), getting our forest garden back to a presentable state for garden tours and creating [accessible courses](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/courses/) to help anyone create a forest garden.
